The constants used in this simulation are defined in constants.h

This will be a relatively standard solar model.
The numerical integration will be done with Euler's method
This will, at least initially, model a homogenous ZAMS star
The mass will be taken as an argument
The composition will be taken from settings.h
    the user is free to edit settings.h for desired simulation

The simulation will primarily be done by numerically
integrating 4 equations:
    hydrostatic equilibrium
    mass continuity
    energy generation
    dT/dr via radiation & convection

The temperature at the boundary (well outside the star itself)
    will be zero. This is not a good assumption, except that there is so
    little mass that it will be able to change very rapidly
